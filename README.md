# Brad's Quick Vagrant + WordPress Starter

Before moving ahead with this starter environment you'll need to have the following things install on your computer:

* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) - Free tool that allows you to run virtual machines on your computer.
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) - Free tool that automates the creation of development environments within a virtual machine.

That's technically all you need to get your WordPress development environment up and running. However, my setup also leverages a few workflow tools. If you'd like to take full advantage of my setup you'll also want to install:

* [Node & NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Node is a free tool that can run JavaScript outside the context of a web browser. NPM is the most popular JavaScript package manager in the world.
* [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) - Free tool that bundles up multiple files.
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) - Free task-runner tool. No longer the cool kid on the block (webpack owns that title now) but I still prefer Gulp for generic task running and non-bundle'ish tasks.
